# emmas-game

## TODO

- refactor code so that it's cleaner (create world object to contain all application state)
- add testing framework
- write tests to ensure functionality works properly (collision detection for example)
- fix 1 pixel off bug
- player can shoot bullet based on last movement (pressed up, shoots up),
  once the bullet reaches the end it is removed
- add another player to game (who can move too)
- players dies if hit by another players bullet
- last player standing wins
- bullet color the same as the player

## Later

- make it run on a server so that you can use your phone/tablet/computer to play

## Design

- express js web server
- use lokijs in memory database
- use socket.io

- gamer visit the '/' and gets the index.html page
